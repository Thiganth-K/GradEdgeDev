# New Question Template — Plain Language

What this feature does
- Contributors can create practice questions for students.
- Each question can include multiple pictures for the main question and multiple pictures for each solution.

How to use it (for non-technical users)
- Go to the contributor dashboard and open "Placement Ready Questions." 
- Click "+ New Question" to open the form.
- Fill in the subject, question type, question text, and answer options.
- To add pictures for the question:
  - You can select several files at once, or use the "Add One" button to add pictures one at a time.
  - Thumbnails of the pictures appear in the form so you can review them before submitting.
- To add pictures for a solution:
  - Add a solution block, then either select multiple pictures or use "Add One" for that solution.
  - Each solution shows its own pictures.
- When ready, click "Create" to save the question.

What happens after you submit
- The system uploads the pictures and saves the question.
- If you later edit the question and replace pictures, the old pictures are removed from the storage automatically.
- If deletion of images fails for some reason, the question still gets removed or updated; the system will show a warning about the images.

Who can use it
- Only verified contributors can add or edit questions.

Benefits
- Allows richer question content with multiple images.
- Keeps older question views working by keeping the main picture where expected.

Simple rules and tips
- Use common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF).
- Keep each image reasonably small to speed up uploads.
- Use the preview thumbnails to confirm you picked the right images.

If something goes wrong
- If the form shows an error, read the message. If it says the image upload failed, try again or try smaller images.
- If you see a warning after deleting a question about images, the question was still deleted but some pictures could not be removed; contact the dev team if you need cleanup.

Contact
- For help, reach out to the platform maintainers or open an issue describing the problem and which question (ID or subject) was affected.
